Slivered onions previously served on McDonald’s Quarter Pounder burgers are the likely source of contamination, based on epidemiologic and traceback data. McDonald’s is no longer using slivered onions on Quarter Pounders at stores in affected states. Diced onions used at McDonald’s have not been implicated in this outbreak. On October 22, 2024, Taylor Farms initiated a voluntary recall of some onions sent to food service customers. Food service customers who were impacted have been contacted directly.
