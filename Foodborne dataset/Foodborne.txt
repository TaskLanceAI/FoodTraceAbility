On August 9, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a Warning Letter to AUSTROFOOD S.A.S. (Austrofood), the manufacturer of the apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches that were recalled last year and that were found to contain elevated levels of lead and chromium. The letter is part of the agencyâ€™s ongoing efforts to enhance the safety of cinnamon, ground spices, and other foods, particularly those consumed by babies and young children.  

As part of a multistate investigation including the FDA, the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, the North Carolina Department of Agriculture & Consumer Services, the Maryland Department of Health, and the Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture, laboratory analysis of multiple lots of the apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches detected extremely high concentrations of lead in the pouches. The presence of these levels of lead causes these products, manufactured at the Austrofood facility in Ecuador, to be adulterated under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) because they bear or contain an added poisonous or deleterious substance which may render them injurious to health. By shipping the apple cinnamon fruit puree pouches to the U.S., Austrofood caused the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of adulterated food in violation of section 301(a) of the FD&C Act.
